scram is a fast paced first and third person shooter game where you play as peasants or mutants. as peasants you must find  the radio and call for rescue however as mutants your goal is to do anything in your power to stop the peasants from escaping. buy items and powerups from the lobby and play the game.

KILL YOURSEL-
If you leave now, you lose everything.
You could get arrested for this.
I thought someone should tell you that your mother has died, of ligma. 
I've been checking you out, from your walls.
Midnight, on the Hays Street Bridge, Come alone.
Do you think he killed the game on purpose?
You've been living in denial all these years?
She's been missing since Friday and you're not worried?
She doesn't understand you like I do.
I want you breathe the smoldering heat, I inhale, I exhale.
Tell me what you saw, for christ's sake!
You stand there and accuse me, but where were you at the time?
Why would you want to put yourself through something like this?
I don't want to have a baby.
You got a package of peanuts.
You've taken her back? You can't be serious?
Is there something you want to tell me, son?
There was blood everywhere.
Life is about more than just surviving.
It's nothing, I'm just tired.
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
